Reference Documentation:-
A rate limiter is a tool that monitors the number of requests per a window time a service agrees to allow. If the request count exceeds the number agreed by the service owner and the user (in a decided window time), the rate limiter blocks all the excess calls (say by throwing exceptions). The user can be a human or any other service (ex: in a micro service-based architecture)
